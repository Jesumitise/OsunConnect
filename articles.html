                <p>Ife (aka Ile-Ife) was an ancient African city which flourished between
                   the 11th and 15th century CE in what is today Nigeria in West Africa. Ife
                   was the capital and principal religious centre of the Yoruba kingdom of Ife, which prospered thanks to trade connections with other West African kingdoms.
                   Ife is particularly famous today for the magnificent metal sculptures its artists produced which include serene-looking human heads so masterfully crafted that Europeans once wrongly considered them the work of another civilization.
                   Located in today's Nigeria along the Guinea coast of southern West Africa, Ife controlled the rainforest to the west of the River Niger delta.
                   Ife was founded c. 500 CE by the Yoruba people - a Kwa-speaking people of southwest Nigeria and Benin - but did not flourish until the early part of the 2nd millennium CE. Ife culture may have been influenced or somehow connected to the kingdom of Igbo-Ukwu, which peaked in the 9th century CE on the other side of the River Niger, but details of this period of history in southern West Africa are lacking.
                   The kingdom of Ife had disappeared by the 16th century CE for reasons which are unknown.

        <h1>Osun-Osogbo Festival</h1>
        <section>
            <div>
            
                <p>
                    The festival of Osun-Osgobo, which takes place every year in Osogbo, Nigeria, celebrates the goddess of fertility, Osun. The festival renews the contract between humans and the divine: Osun offers grace to the community; in return, it vows to honor her Sacred Grove.
                    The festival is believed to renew the contract between humans and deities and it usually attracts the attention of tonnes of people from all walks of life. Quite many are festivals that are not recognised, but the festival in discourse is conspicuous and it has gained root in the annals of Yoruba land.
                    The annual Osun Osogbo festival was celebrated uniquely this year with the massive turnout of devotees, tourists from within and abroad, visitors, fun seekers, journalists, and residents compared to attendance in recent years; they do this not for mere attendance but to receive myriads of blessings from the river goddess.
                    It is believed that appeasing this deity is a panacea to various diseases or ailments, it gives fruitfulness to barren women, it serves as protection to the entire town, and it also unifies the people, especially Osun indigenes, to mention but a few.
                    In his remarks at a special programme he organised at Timehin Middle School, Isale, Osun Osogbo, shortly after the sacrifice at Osun grove, the Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland and leader of the Oodua Peoples Congress OPC Gani Adams, noted that the economic impact of the festival to Osogbo residents will linger on for long.
                    Osun Osogbo festival is a world-recognised annual event and the grove indeed is a World Heritage Site listed by the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation UNESCO.

        <h1>Odun-Olojo Festival</h1>
        <section>
            <div>
            
                <p>
                    Celebrated annually by the people of Ife, the festival name 'Olojo' means 'the day of the first dawn' but in the history of Ile-Ife, the Olojo Festival is to mark the day the Almighty created the earth.
                    The celebration of Olojo usually spans two weeks, including seven sacred days of programmes of events scheduled for September which is the Idijo, meaning the determination of sacred dates. This is done during the first week of August, (Osu Ogun)-the month of the pathfinder deity. This is followed by Gbajure (signalling the commencement of Olojo Festival), a week before the actual date of Olojo.
                    Two days after these events, the Ooni of Ife, would go into a state of physical and spiritual seclusion with his ancestors, the esoteric beings and Almighty God for five days during which he does not interact with any mortal. The traditional ruler would come out of seclusion on a Friday, referred to as Ojo Ilagun, a day of earth cleansing with the Ooni’s terrestrial message to the world.During the climax of the colourful festival, characterised by pomp at Oduduwa House, where the Ooni’s palace is located, a mammoth crowd converged to catch a glimpse of the Ooni of Ife as he meandered through the crowd from the Emese Court, while donning the mysterious “Aare Crown.” The crown is the only physical symbol of authority the Ooni of Ife inherited from his ancestors and it is believed to be the original crown used by Oduduwa during his reign in the classical era of Yoruba history.

        <h1>Obafemi Awolowo University</h1>

                <p>
                    Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) is a federal government-owned university that is located in the ancient city of Ile-Ife, Osun State, Nigeria. The university was founded in 1961 and classes commenced in October 1962 as the "University of Ife" by the regional government of Western Nigeria, which was led by Samuel Ladoke Akintola.
                    In 1951, with the adoption of a new constitution, major changes were made to elected legislators and regional Premiers in the regions. The new regional governments prioritised expansion of primary and secondary education because they viewed education as an important agent of transformation and development. In 1959, the Federal Minister of Education created a commission to research the country's future manpower needs of university graduates between 1960 and 1980. The commission was headed by Cambridge lecturer Eric Ashby, master at Clare College, Cambridge, and also included labour economist Frederick H. Harbison. The expectation of the commission's final report by the Western Region government was that University of Ibadan would satisfy the needs of the Western region, a position on which the federal government disagreed. Before a final report was submitted in October 1960, the Western government began preparations for the establishment of a university in the region.
                    The decision to establish the University of Ife by the ruling Action Group party of the Western Region of Nigeria was in protest at the recommendations of the Ashby Report. The first Nigerian university was established in 1948 at Ibadan in the Western Region as an external college of the University of London. The needs of Nigeria (then a British colony), however, exceeded the productivity of the country's only university.
